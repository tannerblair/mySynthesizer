Place the audio files for the drums and the user audio in the following directory on the myRIO:
* Open MAX and find the myRIO under "Remote Systems"
* Right-click on the device and select "Web Configuration"
* In the web configuration, select "login". 
	-For the myRIO that ships with the demo the user name and password are both "admin".
	-If this is a new myRIO:
		* Under the "Security Configuration" tab, create a new user. 
		  Despite the fact that it will let you create an account with no password, you need to create a password.
		* Log in to the device.
* On the "Remote File Browser" tab, navigate to the following location:
	/C/ni-rt/startup
* Upload the audio files.
